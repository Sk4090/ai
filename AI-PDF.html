    <h2>1. Prepare a note on decade wise historical aspects of Artificial Intelligence.</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) research began formally in the mid-1950s. Its history is marked by periods of optimism ("AI Summers") followed by disillusionment and funding cuts ("AI Winters").</p>

    <h3>1950s: The Birth of AI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Key Event:** Dartmouth Workshop (1956) â€“ Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and brought together founding fathers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon.</li>
        <li>**Early Successes:** Logic Theorist (Newell & Simon) proved theorems, Samuel's Checkers program demonstrated learning.</li>
        <li>**Focus:** Symbolic reasoning, problem-solving, game playing, search algorithms. High optimism prevailed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1960s: Continued Optimism & Early Systems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Developments:** Creation of LISP (McCarthy), development of early chatbots like ELIZA (Weizenbaum), work on General Problem Solver (GPS) by Newell & Simon. Research centers established at MIT, CMU, Stanford, and Edinburgh.</li>
        <li>**Focus:** Continued work on search, logic, and early natural language processing. Minsky and Papert's "Perceptrons" book dampened connectionist research.</li>
        <li>**Challenges:** Problems proved harder than anticipated, especially "common sense" reasoning and handling ambiguity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1970s: Reality Check & First AI Winter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Issues:** Overly optimistic predictions failed to materialize. Limitations in computational power and the complexity of real-world problems became apparent (combinatorial explosion). The Lighthill Report (UK) and reduced DARPA funding led to decreased research (AI Winter).</li>
        <li>**Progress:** Despite funding cuts, significant progress was made in specific areas like knowledge representation (semantic networks, frames) and early expert systems (e.g., DENDRAL for chemistry, MYCIN for medical diagnosis).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1980s: The Expert Systems Boom & Connectionism Revival</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Expert Systems:** Commercial success of rule-based expert systems (e.g., XCON for configuring computer systems) reignited interest and investment. Focus shifted to capturing human expertise in narrow domains.</li>
        <li>**Connectionism:** The backpropagation algorithm (rediscovered/popularized by Rumelhart, Hinton, Williams) enabled training of multi-layer neural networks, reviving interest in connectionist approaches that had stalled in the 1960s.</li>
        <li>**Hardware:** Specialized Lisp machines were developed. Japan launched the ambitious Fifth Generation Computer Systems project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1990s: Machine Learning, Probabilistic Methods, and Integration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Shift:** The expert system market collapsed due to brittleness and knowledge acquisition bottlenecks. Focus shifted towards more robust, data-driven approaches.</li>
        <li>**Key Techniques:** Rise of machine learning (e.g., Support Vector Machines), probabilistic reasoning (Bayesian networks), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs for speech recognition), and evolutionary computation.</li>
        <li>**Integration:** AI techniques became more integrated into mainstream computing (data mining, logistics, web search). IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in chess (1997).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2000s: Big Data, The Web, and ML Ascendancy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Drivers:** Explosion of data available via the World Wide Web and increased computational power made machine learning highly effective.</li>
        *   **Applications:** Statistical machine learning and data mining became dominant. AI powered search engines, recommendation systems, early voice assistants, and spam filters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2010s: The Deep Learning Revolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Breakthroughs:** Deep Learning (neural networks with many layers) achieved major successes, fueled by large datasets (like ImageNet), powerful GPUs for parallel processing, and algorithmic improvements.</li>
        <li>**Key Successes:** State-of-the-art performance in computer vision (image recognition - AlexNet 2012), speech recognition, natural language processing (machine translation, sentiment analysis), and complex game playing (AlphaGo defeating Lee Sedol, 2016). AI became a mainstream topic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2020s: Large Models, Generative AI, and Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Trends:** Development of massive "foundation models" (e.g., GPT-3/4, BERT, DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion) showing remarkable capabilities in generation and few-shot learning. Rise of Generative AI tools.</li>
        <li>**Focus:** Increasing emphasis on AI safety, ethics, fairness, transparency, explainability (XAI), robustness, and societal impact. Ongoing research into energy efficiency, multimodal AI, and neuro-symbolic AI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Suggest at least two heuristic functions for 8-puzzle and provide example calculations for both of them.</h2>
    <p>The 8-puzzle involves a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The goal is to reach a specific target configuration (e.g., numbers 1-8 in order) by sliding tiles into the blank space. Heuristic functions estimate the distance (cost) from the current state to the goal state.</p>

    <p><strong>Goal State:</strong></p>
    <pre>
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 _
    </pre>

    <p><strong>Example Start State:</strong></p>
    <pre>
2 8 3
1 6 4
7 _ 5
    </pre>
    (Where '_' represents the blank space)

    <h3>Heuristic 1: Number of Misplaced Tiles (h1)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> This heuristic counts the number of tiles (excluding the blank) that are not in their correct final position.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Calculation for Example Start State:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Tile 1: Misplaced</li>
            <li>Tile 2: Misplaced</li>
            <li>Tile 3: Correct</li>
            <li>Tile 4: Misplaced</li>
            <li>Tile 5: Misplaced</li>
            <li>Tile 6: Misplaced</li>
            <li>Tile 7: Correct</li>
            <li>Tile 8: Misplaced</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>h1(state) = 6</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Admissibility:</strong> Yes, because each misplaced tile must be moved at least once. It never overestimates the actual cost.</p>

    <h3>Heuristic 2: Manhattan Distance (h2)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> This heuristic calculates the sum of the Manhattan distances (sum of horizontal and vertical moves required) for each tile (excluding the blank) from its current position to its goal position.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Calculation for Example Start State:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Tile 1: Current (1,0), Goal (0,0) -> Distance = |1-0| + |0-0| = 1</li>
            <li>Tile 2: Current (0,0), Goal (0,1) -> Distance = |0-0| + |0-1| = 1</li>
            <li>Tile 3: Current (0,2), Goal (0,2) -> Distance = |0-0| + |2-2| = 0</li>
            <li>Tile 4: Current (1,2), Goal (1,0) -> Distance = |1-1| + |2-0| = 2</li>
            <li>Tile 5: Current (2,2), Goal (1,1) -> Distance = |2-1| + |2-1| = 2</li>
            <li>Tile 6: Current (1,1), Goal (1,2) -> Distance = |1-1| + |1-2| = 1</li>
            <li>Tile 7: Current (2,0), Goal (2,0) -> Distance = |2-2| + |0-0| = 0</li>
            <li>Tile 8: Current (0,1), Goal (2,1) -> Distance = |0-2| + |1-1| = 2</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>h2(state) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 9</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Admissibility:</strong> Yes, because each move can only decrease the Manhattan distance of one tile by exactly one. It never overestimates the actual number of moves required and is generally more informed (provides a better estimate) than the misplaced tiles heuristic.</p>

    <h2>4. Discuss the local maxima problem with the example of block problem.</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Hill Climbing Search:</strong> Hill climbing is an optimization algorithm that belongs to the family of local search. It's an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem and then attempts to find a better solution by incrementally changing a single element of the solution. If the change produces a better solution, an incremental change is made to the new solution, repeating until no further improvements can be found. The "climbing" metaphor comes from visualizing the search space as a landscape where the height corresponds to the value of the objective/heuristic function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Local Maximum Problem:</strong> A significant drawback of simple hill climbing is that it can get stuck in suboptimal solutions called local maxima. A local maximum is a state that is better (higher value according to the heuristic) than all its immediate neighbors but is not the best possible state in the entire search space (the global maximum). Once the algorithm reaches the "peak" of a local maximum, it sees no neighbors with a better value, and thus terminates, potentially far from the optimal solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Example using the Blocks World:</h3>
    <p>
        Consider a simple Blocks World scenario:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> A, B, C</li>
            <li><strong>Initial State (S0):</strong> C on A, A on Table, B on Table. `[On(C,A), OnTable(A), Clear(C), OnTable(B), Clear(B), ArmEmpty]`</li>
            <li><strong>Goal State (G):</strong> A on B, B on C, C on Table. `[On(A,B), On(B,C), OnTable(C), Clear(A)]`</li>
            <li><strong>Heuristic Function (h):</strong> For each block correctly placed according to the goal: +1 point. For each block incorrectly placed: -1 point.
                <ul>
                    <li>`On(A,B)` contributes +1 if true, -1 otherwise.</li>
                    <li>`On(B,C)` contributes +1 if true, -1 otherwise.</li>
                    <li>`OnTable(C)` contributes +1 if true, -1 otherwise.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Calculating Heuristic Values:**</p>
    <ul>
        <li>h(S0): A not on B (-1), B not on C (-1), C not on Table (-1). Total = -3.</li>
        <li>h(G): A on B (+1), B on C (+1), C on Table (+1). Total = +3 (Global Maximum).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Hill Climbing Process leading to a Local Maximum:**</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start at S0:</strong> `[On(C,A), OnTable(A), Clear(C), OnTable(B), Clear(B), ArmEmpty]`. h(S0) = -3.</li>
        <li><strong>Possible Moves from S0:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Move C to Table: `S1 = [OnTable(A), Cl(A), OnTable(B), Cl(B), OnTable(C), Cl(C), ArmEmpty]`.
                    h(S1): A not on B (-1), B not on C (-1), C on Table (+1). Total = -1.</li>
                <li>Move B onto A: `S2 = [On(C,A), Cl(C), On(B,A), Cl(B), OnTable(A), ArmEmpty]`.
                    h(S2): A not on B (-1), B not on C (-1), C not on Table (-1). Total = -3.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choose Best Neighbor:** S1 (h=-1) is better than S0 (h=-3) and S2 (h=-3). Move to S1.
        Current State: `S1 = [OnTable(A), Cl(A), OnTable(B), Cl(B), OnTable(C), Cl(C), ArmEmpty]`. h(S1) = -1.</li>
        <li><strong>Possible Moves from S1:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Move A onto B: `S3 = [On(A,B), Cl(A), OnTable(B), OnTable(C), Cl(C), ArmEmpty]`.
                    h(S3): A on B (+1), B not on C (-1), C on Table (+1). Total = +1.</li>
                <li>Move B onto A: `S4 = [On(B,A), Cl(B), OnTable(A), OnTable(C), Cl(C), ArmEmpty]`.
                    h(S4): A not on B (-1), B not on C (-1), C on Table (+1). Total = -1.</li>
                <li>Move B onto C: `S5 = [On(B,C), Cl(B), OnTable(C), OnTable(A), Cl(A), ArmEmpty]`.
                    h(S5): A not on B (-1), B on C (+1), C on Table (+1). Total = +1.</li>
                <li>Move A onto C: `S6 = [On(A,C), Cl(A), OnTable(C), OnTable(B), Cl(B), ArmEmpty]`.
                    h(S6): A not on B (-1), B not on C (-1), C on Table (+1). Total = -1.</li>
                <li>(Other moves like C onto A/B are similar or worse).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choose Best Neighbor:** Both S3 (A on B) and S5 (B on C) have h = +1, which is better than S1 (h=-1). Let's say the algorithm chooses S3.
        Current State: `S3 = [On(A,B), Cl(A), OnTable(B), OnTable(C), Cl(C), ArmEmpty]`. h(S3) = +1.</li>
        <li><strong>Possible Moves from S3 (Neighbors of Local Maximum):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Move A to Table: Results in S1 again. h(S1) = -1.</li>
                <li>(No other blocks can be moved without first moving A).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stuck at Local Maximum:** From state S3 (h=+1), the only possible move leads back to S1 (h=-1), which has a lower heuristic value. Since hill climbing only moves to states with strictly higher values (or equal in some variants, leading to plateau problems), the algorithm terminates at S3. This is a **local maximum** because it's better than its neighbor (S1), but it's not the global maximum (S_Goal, h=+3). The algorithm failed to find the optimal stack A-B-C because it required intermediate steps (like putting B on C first) that might not have immediately increased the heuristic score from every state.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Solutions:** Techniques like random-restart hill climbing, simulated annealing, or tabu search are used to escape local optima.</p>

    <h2>5. Explain the role of Alpha Beta pruning in game playing with example.</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Role:</strong> Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm, which is commonly used in two-player zero-sum games (like Chess, Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe). Its primary role is to **reduce the number of nodes** evaluated in the game tree search. It achieves this by identifying and "pruning" branches of the tree that cannot possibly influence the final decision, without affecting the outcome determined by the full Minimax search. This significantly speeds up the search process, allowing the algorithm to look deeper into the game tree within the same amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Minimax Background:</strong> Minimax assumes two players, MAX (trying to maximize the score) and MIN (trying to minimize the score), play optimally. It explores the game tree, assigning values to states based on the outcome or a heuristic evaluation. MAX nodes choose the maximum value from their children, while MIN nodes choose the minimum.

        <strong>Alpha-Beta Mechanism:</strong>
        The algorithm maintains two values during the depth-first traversal of the game tree:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha (Î±):</strong> The best (highest) value found so far for the MAX player on the path from the root to the current node. Initialized to -âˆž.</li>
            <li><strong>Beta (Î²):</strong> The best (lowest) value found so far for the MIN player on the path from the root to the current node. Initialized to +âˆž.</li>
        </ul>
        These values represent the bounds of the possible score. Pruning occurs when:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>At a MIN Node:</strong> If the current value being evaluated (`v`) is less than or equal to Alpha (`v <= Î±`), MIN can stop evaluating further children of this node. This is because the MAX player (an ancestor) already has a choice that guarantees a score of at least Î±, so MAX will never choose this path which leads to a score of `v` or less. This is called an **Alpha Cutoff**.</li>
            <li><strong>At a MAX Node:</strong> If the current value being evaluated (`v`) is greater than or equal to Beta (`v >= Î²`), MAX can stop evaluating further children of this node. This is because the MIN player (an ancestor) already has a choice that guarantees a score of at most Î², so MIN will never allow MAX to reach this state which offers a score of `v` or more. This is called a **Beta Cutoff**.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>Consider this simplified game tree where leaf nodes represent evaluation scores (higher is better for MAX):</p>
    <pre>
          A (MAX) Î±=-âˆž Î²=+âˆž
         / \
        /   \
 B (MIN) Î±=-âˆž Î²=+âˆž    C (MIN) Î±=3 Î²=+âˆž
 /     \             /     \
D (MAX) E (MAX)      F (MAX) G (MAX)
/ \     / \          / \     / \
3  5    6 (X)        2  (X)  8  (X)
    </pre>
    <p>(X indicates nodes that might be pruned)</p>

    <p><strong>Execution Trace:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>**A (MAX):** Î±=-âˆž, Î²=+âˆž. Call Minimax(B, -âˆž, +âˆž).</li>
        <li>**B (MIN):** Î±=-âˆž, Î²=+âˆž. Call Minimax(D, -âˆž, +âˆž).</li>
        <li>**D (MAX):** Î±=-âˆž, Î²=+âˆž.
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluate child 3. D's value >= 3. Update D's Î± = 3.</li>
                <li>Evaluate child 5. D's value >= 5. Update D's Î± = 5.</li>
                <li>D returns 5.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**B (MIN):** Received 5 from D. MIN wants the minimum. Update B's Î² = min(+âˆž, 5) = 5. Now B knows it can achieve a score of *at most* 5. Call Minimax(E, -âˆž, 5).</li>
        <li>**E (MAX):** Î±=-âˆž, Î²=5.
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluate child 6. E's value >= 6. Update E's Î± = 6.</li>
                <li>**PRUNING (Beta Cutoff):** Check if Î± >= Î² (i.e., 6 >= 5). Yes! MIN player B already has an option yielding 5 (from D). MAX player E is finding a move yielding 6, but MIN player B will never choose E's path because 5 is better (lower) for MIN than 6. So, B doesn't need to know E's exact best value if it's already 6 or more. Stop exploring E's children. Prune any remaining children of E.</li>
                <li>E returns its current Î± value (6).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**B (MIN):** Received 6 from E. Compares D(5) and E(6). Chooses minimum: 5. B returns 5 to A.</li>
        <li>**A (MAX):** Received 5 from B. MAX wants maximum. Update A's Î± = max(-âˆž, 5) = 5. Now MAX knows it can achieve *at least* 5. Call Minimax(C, 5, +âˆž).</li>
        <li>**C (MIN):** Î±=5, Î²=+âˆž. Call Minimax(F, 5, +âˆž).</li>
        <li>**F (MAX):** Î±=5, Î²=+âˆž.
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluate child 2. F's value >= 2. Update F's Î± = max(5, 2) = 5. (F's *local* best is 2, but it respects the alpha passed down).</li>
                <li>**PRUNING (Alpha Cutoff at sibling, indirectly):** Let's assume F had another child, say 4. F's value >= 4. F's Î± becomes 4. F returns 4.</li>
            </ul>
            *(Corrected walk-through:)*
            <ul>
                 <li>Evaluate child 2. F's value is 2. F's *local* best is 2. Keep Î±=5, Î²=+âˆž.</li>
                 <li>*No pruning yet.* If F had another child, say 1, F would return 2. If F had another child, say 9, F's local alpha becomes 9. F would return 9. Let's assume F only has child 2 for simplicity or its best is 2. F returns 2.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
        <li>**C (MIN):** Received 2 from F. MIN wants minimum. Update C's Î² = min(+âˆž, 2) = 2. Now C knows it can achieve a score of *at most* 2. Call Minimax(G, 5, 2).</li>
        <li>**G (MAX):** Î±=5, Î²=2.
            <ul>
                <li>**PRUNING (Alpha Cutoff Condition Check):** Before evaluating children, check if Î± >= Î² (i.e., 5 >= 2). Yes! MAX player A already has a move guaranteeing a score of 5 (via B). MIN player C is currently exploring path G, but the bound Î²=2 indicates MIN can already force a score of 2 or less down this path (from F). MAX player A will never choose the path through C (guaranteeing only <=2) when it already has a path guaranteeing >=5. **Therefore, prune the entire subtree under G (nodes N, O, and any others).** G does not need evaluation.</li>
                <li>G immediately returns a value (doesn't matter much, often Î²=2 is returned conceptually).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**C (MIN):** Received a value (e.g., 2) from G after pruning. C compares F(2) and G(pruned, effectively <=2). C chooses minimum: 2. C returns 2 to A.</li>
        <li>**A (MAX):** Received 2 from C. A compares B(5) and C(2). Chooses maximum: 5.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:** The final result is 5. Alpha-beta pruning avoided evaluating nodes K, N, and O, speeding up the search without changing the outcome.</p>

    <h2>6. Discuss the STRIPS domain with block problem example.</h2>
    <p>
        STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) is a classic and influential formalism used in automated planning to represent planning problems. It defines states, goals, and actions in a structured way, suitable for algorithms that search for a sequence of actions to achieve a goal.
    </p>

    <h3>Components of a STRIPS Domain Description:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>States:</strong> A state is described by a set (conjunction) of positive ground literals (atomic facts). For example, `On(A,B)`, `OnTable(B)`, `Clear(A)`. Facts not explicitly listed are assumed to be false (Closed World Assumption).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Goal:</strong> A goal is a set (conjunction) of positive ground literals that must be true in the final state. The planner aims to find *any* state that satisfies all goal literals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Actions (Operators):</strong> Actions define how the state can be changed. Each action schema has:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Action Name & Parameters:</strong> Identifies the action and its variables (e.g., `Stack(object, underObject)`).</li>
                <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> A set of positive literals that must hold true in the current state for the action to be applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Effects:</strong> The changes the action makes to the state:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Add List:</strong> A set of positive literals that become true after the action.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delete List:</strong> A set of positive literals that are no longer true after the action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Blocks World Example in STRIPS:</h3>
    <p>The Blocks World is a standard planning domain involving stacking blocks on a table or on each other, usually with a single robot arm.</p>

    <p><strong>Predicates (Facts):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>`On(x, y)`: Block `x` is directly on top of block `y`.</li>
        <li>`OnTable(x)`: Block `x` is on the table.</li>
        <li>`Clear(x)`: Block `x` has nothing on top of it.</li>
        <li>`Holding(x)`: The robot arm is holding block `x`.</li>
        <li>`ArmEmpty`: The robot arm is not holding anything.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Actions (Operators):**</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Action:</strong> `Stack(x, y)` (Stack block `x` onto block `y`)
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> `Holding(x)`, `Clear(y)`</li>
                <li><strong>Add List:</strong> `ArmEmpty`, `On(x, y)`, `Clear(x)`</li>
                <li><strong>Delete List:</strong> `Holding(x)`, `Clear(y)`</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Action:</strong> `Unstack(x, y)` (Unstack block `x` from block `y`)
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> `On(x, y)`, `Clear(x)`, `ArmEmpty`</li>
                <li><strong>Add List:</strong> `Holding(x)`, `Clear(y)`</li>
                <li><strong>Delete List:</strong> `On(x, y)`, `Clear(x)`, `ArmEmpty`</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Action:</strong> `Pickup(x)` (Pick up block `x` from the table)
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> `OnTable(x)`, `Clear(x)`, `ArmEmpty`</li>
                <li><strong>Add List:</strong> `Holding(x)`</li>
                <li><strong>Delete List:</strong> `OnTable(x)`, `Clear(x)`, `ArmEmpty`</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Action:</strong> `Putdown(x)` (Put block `x` down on the table)
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> `Holding(x)`</li>
                <li><strong>Add List:</strong> `ArmEmpty`, `OnTable(x)`, `Clear(x)`</li>
                <li><strong>Delete List:</strong> `Holding(x)`</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example Planning Problem:**</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial State (S0):</strong> `{ On(C,A), OnTable(A), OnTable(B), Clear(C), Clear(B), ArmEmpty }`</li>
        <li><strong>Goal State (G):</strong> `{ On(A,B), On(B,C) }` (Implies `OnTable(C)`)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Planning Process (Conceptual):**</p>
    <p>A STRIPS planner would search for a sequence of actions to transform S0 into a state satisfying G. For example, a possible plan could be:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>`Unstack(C, A)`</li>
        <li>`Putdown(C)`</li>
        <li>`Pickup(B)`</li>
        <li>`Stack(B, C)`</li>
        <li>`Pickup(A)`</li>
        <li>`Stack(A, B)`</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each step involves checking if the preconditions are met in the current state and then updating the state according to the action's add and delete lists.</p>
    <p>The STRIPS representation provides a clear, logical framework for defining planning problems and allows algorithms like forward-chaining state-space search, backward-chaining goal regression, or plan-space planning to find solutions.</p>

    <h2>7. Explain the steps for resolution with refutation with example.</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Resolution with Refutation</strong> is a proof technique used in automated theorem proving, particularly for propositional and first-order logic. It's a sound and complete inference method for determining if a set of logical sentences (Knowledge Base, KB) entails another sentence (Query). It works by showing that assuming the negation of the query leads to a contradiction when combined with the KB.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Literal:</strong> An atomic sentence (e.g., `P`) or its negation (e.g., `Â¬P`).</li>
        <li><strong>Clause:</strong> A disjunction (OR) of one or more literals (e.g., `P âˆ¨ Â¬Q âˆ¨ R`).</li>
        <li><strong>Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):</strong> A logical sentence expressed as a conjunction (AND) of clauses. Any sentence in propositional or first-order logic can be converted to CNF.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution Rule:</strong> From two clauses containing complementary literals (one positive, one negative), a new clause (the resolvent) can be inferred by combining all other literals from the two parent clauses.
            <ul>
                <li>Propositional: `(A âˆ¨ B) âˆ§ (Â¬B âˆ¨ C)` resolves to `(A âˆ¨ C)`.</li>
                <li>First-Order (with unification): `(Â¬P(x) âˆ¨ Q(x))` and `(P(A) âˆ¨ R(y))` can resolve. First, unify `P(x)` and `P(A)` with substitution `{x/A}`. The complementary literals are `Â¬P(A)` and `P(A)`. The resolvent is `(Q(A) âˆ¨ R(y))`.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Empty Clause (`{}` or `â–¡`):</strong> Represents a contradiction (False). Deriving the empty clause means the original set of clauses is unsatisfiable.</li>
        <li><strong>Refutation:** Proof by contradiction. To prove `KB |= Query`, show that `KB âˆ§ Â¬Query` is unsatisfiable (leads to the empty clause).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps for Resolution Refutation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Convert KB and Â¬Query to Clausal Form (CNF):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminate implications (`A â†’ B` becomes `Â¬A âˆ¨ B`).</li>
                <li>Move negations inward (using De Morgan's laws, e.g., `Â¬(A âˆ§ B)` becomes `Â¬A âˆ¨ Â¬B`, `Â¬(A âˆ¨ B)` becomes `Â¬A âˆ§ Â¬B`, `Â¬âˆ€x P(x)` becomes `âˆƒx Â¬P(x)`, `Â¬âˆƒx P(x)` becomes `âˆ€x Â¬P(x)`).</li>
                <li>Standardize variables apart (rename variables so each quantifier has a unique variable name).</li>
                <li>Skolemize (eliminate existential quantifiers by replacing variables with Skolem functions or constants).</li>
                <li>Drop all universal quantifiers (variables are assumed to be universally quantified).</li>
                <li>Distribute OR over AND (`A âˆ¨ (B âˆ§ C)` becomes `(A âˆ¨ B) âˆ§ (A âˆ¨ C)`) to get a conjunction of clauses.</li>
                <li>Separate the conjunctions into a set of individual clauses.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Negate the Query:** Add the CNF clauses of the *negated* query (`Â¬Query`) to the set of clauses derived from the KB.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Resolution Rule Repeatedly:** Select pairs of clauses from the set that contain complementary literals (which may require unification in FOL). Generate the resolvent clause and add it to the set.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Termination:**
            <ul>
                <li>If the **empty clause (`{}` or `â–¡`)** is generated, the original set of clauses (KB âˆ§ Â¬Query) is unsatisfiable. This means the assumption (`Â¬Query`) was false, and therefore the original Query is entailed by the KB (`KB |= Query`). The proof is successful.</li>
                <li>If no new clauses can be generated and the empty clause has not been derived, the Query is not entailed by the KB.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example (Propositional Logic):</h3>
    <p><strong>KB:**</p>
    <ul>
        <li>R1: If it is raining (`R`), then the ground is wet (`W`). (`R â†’ W`)</li>
        <li>R2: If the sprinkler is on (`S`), then the ground is wet (`W`). (`S â†’ W`)</li>
        <li>R3: It is raining (`R`).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Query:** Is the ground wet? (`W`)</p>

    <p><strong>Steps:**</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Convert to CNF:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>R1: `R â†’ W` becomes `Â¬R âˆ¨ W`. Clause 1: `{Â¬R, W}`</li>
                <li>R2: `S â†’ W` becomes `Â¬S âˆ¨ W`. Clause 2: `{Â¬S, W}`</li>
                <li>R3: `R` -> Clause 3: `{R}`</li>
                <li>Â¬Query: `Â¬W`. Clause 4: `{Â¬W}`</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Set of Clauses:** `{ {Â¬R, W}, {Â¬S, W}, {R}, {Â¬W} }`</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Resolution:**
            <ul>
                <li>Resolve Clause 1 `{Â¬R, W}` and Clause 3 `{R}`:
                    Complementary literals: `Â¬R` and `R`.
                    Resolvent Clause 5: `{W}`
                </li>
                <li>Resolve Clause 5 `{W}` and Clause 4 `{Â¬W}`:
                    Complementary literals: `W` and `Â¬W`.
                    Resolvent Clause 6: **`{ }` (Empty Clause)**
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:** The empty clause was derived. Therefore, the KB entails the query `W`. The ground is wet.</li>

    <h2>8. Write a note on applications of neural networks with all its types.</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes or 'neurons' organized in layers. ANNs learn by processing examples, adjusting the connection strengths (weights) between neurons to minimize the difference between the network's output and the desired output. Different architectures cater to different types of data and tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>Major Types and Applications:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs / MLPs):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The simplest type, where connections do not form cycles. Information flows strictly from input to output layer(s). Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are FNNs with one or more hidden layers.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>General classification (e.g., identifying handwritten digits).</li>
                        <li>Regression (e.g., predicting house prices based on features).</li>
                        <li>Basic pattern recognition.</li>
                        <li>Often used as components within more complex models.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Designed primarily for processing grid-like data (e.g., images). Use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, followed by pooling layers for downsampling and fully connected layers for classification/regression. Key concepts are local receptive fields, shared weights, and spatial invariance.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Image Recognition & Classification (state-of-the-art performance).</li>
                        <li>Object Detection and Segmentation (identifying objects and their boundaries).</li>
                        <li>Video Analysis (action recognition).</li>
                        <li>Medical Image Diagnostics (e.g., tumor detection).</li>
                        <li>Some NLP tasks (e.g., text classification).</li>

    <h2>9. Describe all NLP techniques.</h2>
    <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses a wide array of techniques designed to enable computers to process, understand, and generate human language. These techniques range from basic text manipulation to complex semantic understanding and discourse analysis. They are often used in combination within larger NLP systems. Here's a breakdown of common NLP techniques, categorized by their level of analysis:</p>

    <h3>1. Lexical Processing (Word/Token Level)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Breaking down text into individual units (words, punctuation, symbols) called tokens. Essential first step for most NLP tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Stemming:</strong> Reducing words to their root form by removing suffixes (e.g., "running" -> "run", "studies" -> "studi"). Fast but can be crude.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemmatization:</strong> Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) using vocabulary and morphological analysis. More accurate than stemming but slower (e.g., "ran" -> "run", "better" -> "good").</li>
        <li><strong>Stop Word Removal:</strong> Filtering out common words (e.g., "a", "an", "the", "is") that may not carry significant meaning for tasks like information retrieval or text classification.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Converting text to a standard format (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation, handling numbers, expanding contractions).</li>
        <li><strong>N-grams:** Generating sequences of N consecutive items (words or characters) from text. Used in language modeling and feature extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Bag-of-Words (BoW):** Representing text by the frequency of its words, disregarding grammar and word order.</li>
        <li><strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** A numerical statistic reflecting how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Syntactic Analysis (Grammar/Structure Level)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:</strong> Assigning a grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each token.</li>
        <li><strong>Parsing:** Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constituency Parsing:</strong> Building a hierarchical tree structure representing the phrase structure (e.g., Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase).</li>
                <li><strong>Dependency Parsing:</strong> Representing grammatical relationships between words as a directed graph (e.g., subject-verb, modifier-noun).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Chunking (Shallow Parsing):</strong> Identifying and segmenting the sentence into non-overlapping phrases (e.g., Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases) without constructing a full parse tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Semantic Analysis (Meaning Level)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</strong> Locating and classifying named entities (Persons, Organizations, Locations, Dates, etc.) in text.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):</strong> Determining the specific meaning of a word in context when it has multiple senses (e.g., "bank").</li>
        <li><strong>Relation Extraction:** Identifying semantic relationships between entities (e.g., "LocatedIn(Paris, France)", "WorksFor(John Doe, Google)").</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** Identifying the predicate (verb) and its arguments (agent, patient, instrument, etc.) to understand "who did what to whom".</li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis / Opinion Mining:** Determining the polarity (positive, negative, neutral), subjectivity, or specific emotions expressed in text.</li>
        <li><strong>Topic Modeling (e.g., LDA):** Discovering abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText):** Representing words as dense, low-dimensional vectors capturing semantic similarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence/Document Embeddings (e.g., Doc2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder, BERT embeddings):** Representing larger text units as vectors capturing their meaning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Discourse Analysis (Context/Flow Level)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coreference Resolution:** Linking different textual mentions (pronouns, definite descriptions, names) that refer to the same real-world entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Discourse Parsing:** Analyzing the structure of discourse, identifying relationships between clauses or sentences (e.g., contrast, explanation, elaboration).</li>
        <li><strong>Text Cohesion/Coherence Analysis:** Evaluating how well parts of a text stick together logically and linguistically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Pragmatic Analysis (Intent/Real-World Knowledge)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speech Act Recognition:** Identifying the intention behind an utterance (e.g., requesting, promising, informing).</li>
        <li><strong>Irony/Sarcasm Detection:** Understanding non-literal meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Implicature Understanding:** Inferring meaning that isn't explicitly stated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>High-Level NLP Tasks (Applications):</h3>
    <p>These often integrate multiple techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Machine Translation</li>
        <li>Text Summarization (Extractive/Abstractive)</li>
        <li>Question Answering</li>
        <li>Information Retrieval</li>
        <li>Information Extraction</li>
        <li>Text Generation</li>
        <li>Dialogue Systems / Chatbots</li>
        <li>Speech Recognition & Synthesis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Modern NLP heavily relies on statistical methods and machine learning, especially deep learning models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers, which often learn many of these underlying representations implicitly from large datasets.</p>

    <h2>10. Write a note on MYCIN with all necessary details like its structure, historical aspects, its performance and its expert system shell details.</h2>

    <h3>Introduction & Historical Aspects</h3>
    <p>
        MYCIN was a seminal early expert system developed at Stanford University in the early 1970s, primarily by Edward Shortliffe as part of his PhD research, along with colleagues like Bruce Buchanan. It aimed to diagnose bacterial infections of the blood (bacteremia, septicemia) and meningitis, and to recommend appropriate antibiotic treatments. Developed using the Lisp programming language, MYCIN is considered a landmark system because it demonstrated that AI could achieve expert-level performance in a complex, real-world domain like medicine. It significantly influenced the development of subsequent expert systems and AI research in general.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>MYCIN's architecture consisted of several key components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> This contained the domain-specific medical knowledge. It was primarily composed of around 600 production rules in the form of IF-THEN statements. These rules encoded heuristic knowledge about symptom-disease relationships, patient history factors, and drug contraindications. Example (simplified): <code>IF (site is blood) AND (gram stain is gramneg) AND (morphology is rod) THEN (identity is E. coli) with CF=0.8</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Inference Engine:</strong> This module processed the rules and the specific patient data to reach conclusions. MYCIN used a goal-directed **backward chaining** strategy. It started with potential goals (e.g., identifying the infecting organism) and worked backward, trying to satisfy the IF conditions of rules that concluded the goal. If a condition wasn't known, it would either become a subgoal (triggering other rules) or prompt the user for information.</li>
        <li><strong>Context Tree:** A dynamic data structure representing the patient case, including information about cultures, organisms, and drugs being considered.</li>
        <li><strong>Consultation Driver:** Managed the interaction with the user (typically a physician), asking questions to gather necessary information prompted by the inference engine.</li>
        <li><strong>Explanation Subsystem:** Allowed users to query the system's reasoning. Users could ask "WHY" MYCIN was asking a particular question (revealing the rule being processed) or "HOW" it reached a specific conclusion (showing the chain of rules and evidence used). This was crucial for building trust and debugging the knowledge base.</li>
        <li><strong>Certainty Factors (CFs):</strong> To handle the inherent uncertainty in medical diagnosis, MYCIN employed a novel numerical model called Certainty Factors. Each rule conclusion had an associated CF (ranging from -1 to +1) indicating the strength of belief in that conclusion if the premises were true. The system had rules for combining CFs from multiple pieces of evidence supporting or refuting a hypothesis. This was an ad-hoc alternative to formal probability theory, designed to mimic expert reasoning patterns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>
        MYCIN underwent rigorous evaluation. In a well-known study, its diagnostic and treatment recommendations for meningitis cases were compared against those of faculty specialists, infectious disease fellows, residents, medical students, and general practitioners. The results, judged blindly by external experts, showed that MYCIN's performance was comparable to that of the human specialists and significantly better than the non-specialists. Despite this impressive performance, MYCIN was never implemented for routine clinical use due to several factors, including ethical and legal responsibility issues, integration challenges with existing hospital systems, and the limitations of the user interface technology at the time.
    </p>

    <h3>Expert System Shell (EMYCIN)</h3>
    <p>
        The developers realized that MYCIN's core components â€“ the inference engine, the explanation facility, and the user interface â€“ were largely domain-independent. They separated these components from the medical knowledge base, creating **EMYCIN** (Essential MYCIN, later interpreted as Empty MYCIN). EMYCIN was one of the first **expert system shells**. It provided a framework or toolset that allowed developers to build new expert systems in different domains more rapidly by simply supplying a new knowledge base (rules specific to the new domain). This concept of separating the knowledge from the reasoning mechanism was a major contribution and spurred the development of numerous other expert systems in various fields during the 1980s.
